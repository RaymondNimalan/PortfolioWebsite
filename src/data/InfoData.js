    'Hi! My name is Raymond Nimalan. I am a Fullstack Engineer living in Brooklyn, NY. From a young age, I have always been fascinated with computers and all things tech. But a huge turning point was when I started building computers for myself and my close friends. This hobby fueled the desire and passion to learn as much as I could about computers. The natural progression was to then learn to code in my free time off work.',
  paragraphTwo:
    "I have a proven track record of creating and implementing successful front and back-end applications. I've cultivated a deep passion for developing efficient solutions and products, and I'm always looking to improve my abilities, one line of code at a time. I strive to use my unique background and skill set to create a better, more accessible world we can be proud to live in. I aim to contribute my software engineering skills to a team that prioritizes collaboration and aspires to build a thriving and safer world together.",
