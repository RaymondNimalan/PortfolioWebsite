    'Hi! My name is Raymond Nimalan. I am a Fullstack Engineer from the Washington D.C. area. From a young age, I have always been fascinated with computers and all things tech. But a huge turning point was when I started building computers for myself and my close friends. This hobby fueled the desire and passion to learn as much as I could about computers. The natural progression was to then learn to code in my free time off work.',
  paragraphTwo:
    ' After much research and deliberation, I applied to Fullstack Academy, a 17 week program focused on Javascript and the PERN stack. My hard work paid off and I was accepted into the fall 2020 cohort and later graduated in early 2021. I am extremely excited to see where my new career path takes me and I look forward to working with new diverse groups of people and organizations.',
